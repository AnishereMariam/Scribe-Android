### Scribe language keyboards for Android

This repository would contain the Android version of Scribe. Developers interested in porting [Scribe-iOS](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS) to Android are invited to discuss the project in the [issues](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Android/issues). Contributors would be able to join the Scribe organization, which is currently looking for people interested in bringing Scribe to both Android and desktop as an extension to various platforms.

Thanks for your interest in contributing!
